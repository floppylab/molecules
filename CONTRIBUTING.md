# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :)

You are free to add new molecules, report bugs or add any kind of documentation.

Please do not forget about these:

## coding convention
- we have a custom Checkstyle ruleset ready, so whenever adding new code, do not forget to run the checks! :)

## documentation and issues
- make sure you always have an issue and you applied and got accepted to work on that particular thing
- if you change or add something make sure that you added at least a few lines of docs

## tests
- make sure to add test cases! :)

Thank you very much! :)
